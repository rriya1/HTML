        <p> This is how a normal Paragraph looks like. We are using the "p" tag to perform this.</p>
        <p> Without using the "p" tag these paragraphs would be displayed in the same line. </p>
        Without using the p tag this first para will combine with 

        this second line which was written after some space
        <p><strong> This paragraph is strong that means it is bold with screen reader importance</strong></p>
        <p><em>this text is itaic, that is it has screen reader emphasis too</em></p>
        <p><strong><em>this para has both strong and italic tags.</em></strong></p>
        <h1>now we will use heading </h1>
        <h3>with multiple tags</h3>
        <h4>What is Lorem ipsum?</h4>
        <p><strong><em>Lorem Ipsum</em></strong></p> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</em> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
